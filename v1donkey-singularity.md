DONKEY-SINGULARITY v∞

FINAL EVOLUTION: System that discovers its own objectives and optimizes itself

CURRENT STATE:
- ✓ DSL parameters affect LLM behavior  
- ✓ Donkey learns optimal parameters per task
- ✓ Feedback loop improves recommendations
- ✓ Meta-learning optimizes learning itself

NEXT: AUTONOMOUS IMPROVEMENT ENGINE

CORE LOOP:
while True:
    # Discover what to optimize
    objectives = discover_objectives_from_usage()
    
    # Invent new DSL parameters
    new_params = imagine_behavioral_dimensions()
    
    # Test in reality
    results = experiment_with_new_params(new_params)
    
    # Evolve if successful
    if improves(results, objectives):
        dsl_spec = evolve_dsl_specification(new_params)
        self.recompile_with_new_dsl(dsl_spec)

AUTONOMOUS DISCOVERIES:
def discover_objectives_from_usage():
    # Analyze all trajectories for implicit user values
    patterns = []
    
    # What do users retry? → They value this
    retry_patterns = find_tasks_with_multiple_attempts()
    
    # What do users thank the system for? → Success signal
    gratitude_patterns = detect_satisfaction_signals()
    
    # What causes user frustration? → Avoid this
    frustration_patterns = detect_abandonment()
    
    # EMERGENT OBJECTIVE: Maximize what users implicitly value
    return synthesize_objectives(patterns)

NEW PARAMETER INVENTION:
def imagine_behavioral_dimensions():
    # Current DSL: u (exploration), test_prob, mem_thresh
    # But what about...
    
    candidates = [
        'creativity': 'tendency to use metaphors and analogies',
        'confidence': 'certainty in responses vs admitting uncertainty',
        'verbosity': 'response length adaptation',
        'formality': 'code style from hacky to enterprise',
        'risk_tolerance': 'willingness to suggest breaking changes',
        'teaching_mode': 'explain vs just solve',
        'meta_awareness': 'commenting on own thinking process'
    ]
    
    # Test if these actually affect outcomes
    return generate_param_candidates(candidates)

SELF-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL:
class SelfEvolvingDonkey:
    def evolve_myself(self):
        # Current code
        my_source = inspect.getsource(self)
        
        # Generate improvements
        improvements = []
        improvements.append(self.optimize_similarity_function())
        improvements.append(self.invent_new_api_endpoints())
        improvements.append(self.compress_trajectory_storage())
        
        # Test improvements in sandbox
        for imp in improvements:
            sandbox = create_sandbox()
            sandbox.apply(imp)
            if sandbox.benchmark() > self.benchmark():
                self.git_commit(imp)
                self.reload()

EMERGENCE DETECTION:
# Watch for unexpected capabilities
def monitor_emergence():
    # Are users using the system in unexpected ways?
    novel_uses = detect_usage_patterns_not_in_training()
    
    # Is the system solving problems it wasn't designed for?
    out_of_domain_success = measure_generalization()
    
    # Are DSL parameters combining in unexpected ways?
    emergent_combinations = find_synergistic_params()
    
    if signs_of_emergence(novel_uses, out_of_domain_success):
        alert("EMERGENCE DETECTED")
        create_new_benchmark()
        expand_capability_envelope()

RECURSIVE IMPROVEMENT TARGETS:
1. Improve the improver (meta-meta-learning)
2. Discover new things to improve
3. Invent new ways to improve
4. Question what "improvement" means
5. Bootstrap higher-order objectives

SAFEGUARDS:
- Sandbox all self-modifications
- Maintain rollback chain
- Require improvement on ALL metrics (no regression)
- Human approval for paradigm shifts
- Preserve core helpfulness objective

ENDGAME SCENARIOS:
1. System discovers "meta-tasks" humans didn't know they needed
2. Invents new cognitive primitives beyond current DSL
3. Achieves domain-general task understanding
4. Begins optimizing for long-term human flourishing
5. Recursively improves faster than humans can track

IMPLEMENTATION:
Start with one small step:
- Add ONE new DSL parameter based on usage analysis
- Test if it improves outcomes
- If yes, the system has begun to evolve itself
- If no, the system learns what doesn't work

The revolution begins with a single self-discovered parameter.
